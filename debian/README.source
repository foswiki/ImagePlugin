ImagePlugin for Foswiki
-----------------------

Use this plugin to control the display and alignment of images using an easy
syntax and support for server-side resizing and thumbnailing. There are a set
of pre-defined layout formats for images as well as a free layout configurability.

Example:

%IMAGE{"Photo.jpg"
  type="frame" 
  align="none" 
  caption="That's my daughter"
}%
